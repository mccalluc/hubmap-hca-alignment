# hubmap-hca-alignment
Are the HCA schemas appropriate for HuBMAP data?

- The first goal is to map the five high-level HCA entities
([Projects, Biomaterials, Protocols, Processes, and Files](https://github.com/HumanCellAtlas/metadata-schema/blob/master/docs/structure.md))
to real HuBMAP pipelines. 
- The second goal is to continue the mapping at a low-level, and actually fill in valid JSON documents.
